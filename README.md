Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a preprocessor scripting language that is compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). It simplifies the process of writing CSS by providing features like variables, nesting, mixins, and more. It is a great tool for writing more organized, clean, and standardized CSS.

I decided to learn Sass and delve deeper into my styling knowledge, and this is my first project using Sass.
