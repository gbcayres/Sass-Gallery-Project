Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a preprocessor scripting language that is compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). It simplifies the process of writing CSS by providing features like variables, nesting, mixins, and more. It is a great tool for writing more organized, clean, and standardized CSS.

This project is from the Hora de Codar course by Matheus Battisti -> ![Course Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo5t3uUV8n4&ab_channel=MatheusBattisti-HoradeCodar)

It was my first contact with Sass and I've been introduced to the following concepts:

* Nesting
* Partials
* Includes
* Variables
* Mixins
* Responsiveness
