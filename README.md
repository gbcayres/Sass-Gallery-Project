Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a preprocessor scripting language that is compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). It simplifies the process of writing CSS by providing features like variables, nesting, mixins, and more. It is a great tool for writing more organized, clean, and standardized CSS.

This project is from the Hora de Codar course by Matheus Battisti. It was my first contact with Sass and I've been introduced to the following concepts:

* Nesting
* Partials
* Includes
* Variables
* Mixins
* Responsiveness
